# Release Checklist

Since I always forget something when I create a new release, here is a small checklist for my future me.

* [ ] Read this checklist.
* [ ] Make sure all tests are passing.
* [ ] Do some manual testing.
* [ ] Make sure everything that should be merged is merged. (Dependency updates?)
* [ ] Update Version in `./src/_version.py`.
* [ ] Update Version and Dockerfile links in `./DOCKER_README.md`.
* [ ] Check if the readme file needs to be adjusted.
